# 🔐 Vault Credentials Reference

## 🎉 **Migration Complete!**

Your tokens have been successfully migrated from `.secrets/` files to secure HashiCorp Vault storage.

## 📋 **Token Locations in Vault**

| Token | Vault Path | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **GitLab** | `secret/git/gitlab` | Personal Access Token for GitLab |
| **GitHub** | `secret/git/github` | Personal Access Token for GitHub |

---

## 🔧 **Management Commands**

### **View Token Details** (without exposing actual token)
```bash
./scripts/vault/vault-credentials-manager.sh get git/gitlab
./scripts/vault/vault-credentials-manager.sh get git/github
```

### **Get Specific Token Field**
```bash
# Get just the token value (for scripts)
./scripts/vault/vault-credentials-manager.sh get git/gitlab token

# Get username
./scripts/vault/vault-credentials-manager.sh get git/gitlab username
```

### **Update Tokens**
```bash
# Update GitLab token
./scripts/vault/vault-credentials-manager.sh update git/gitlab token=NEW_TOKEN_HERE

# Update GitHub token  
./scripts/vault/vault-credentials-manager.sh update git/github token=NEW_TOKEN_HERE
```

### **List All Secrets**
```bash
./scripts/vault/vault-credentials-manager.sh list
```

## 🚀 **Vault-Enabled Git Operations**

### **Setup GitLab with Vault Token**
```bash
./scripts/git/setup-gitlab-token-vault.sh
```

### **Dual Commit with Vault**
```bash
./scripts/git/dual-commit-vault.sh "Your commit message"
```

---

## 🛡️ **Security Benefits**

✅ **Encrypted Storage**: Tokens encrypted at rest in Vault  
✅ **Access Control**: Role-based access to secrets  
✅ **Audit Logging**: All access is logged  
✅ **Token Rotation**: Easy to update tokens without touching files  
✅ **No File Storage**: Tokens no longer in filesystem  
✅ **Backup Safe**: Original tokens backed up securely  

---

## 🔄 **Vault Status Commands**

### **Check Vault Health**
```bash
docker exec dev-vault vault status
```

### **Direct Vault Access**
```bash
# Access Vault container
docker exec -it dev-vault sh

# Inside container:
export VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8200
export VAULT_TOKEN=root
vault kv list secret/
```

## 💡 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Vault is not running:**
```bash
cd sec-devops-tools/docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.vault.yml up -d vault
```

### **If tokens need updating:**
```bash
# Update in Vault
./scripts/vault/vault-credentials-manager.sh update git/gitlab token=NEW_TOKEN

# Reconfigure Git remotes
./scripts/git/setup-gitlab-token-vault.sh
```
