# GitHub Actions Runner Scaling Plan

## 🎯 Current Optimization: COMPLETE ✅

### Trigger Management Results
```bash
✅ Workflows converted to manual: 4+ workflows
⚡ Auto-trigger workflows: 1 (ci-cd.yml only)
🎯 Queue reduction: ~80% fewer concurrent runs
```

## 📊 Runner Capacity Analysis

### Current Setup
- **Runners**: 1 (`vault-runner-ubuntu-vm1`)
- **Capacity**: 1 concurrent job
- **Auto-triggers**: Only CI/CD (minimal queue)
- **Manual workflows**: 4+ (run on-demand)

### Do We Need 5 Runners?

**BEFORE optimization**: YES (5 workflows × 1 git push = 5 concurrent jobs)
**AFTER optimization**: NO (1 workflow × 1 git push = 1 concurrent job)

## 🎯 Scaling Recommendations

### Option 1: Current Setup (Recommended)
```
Runners: 1 
Cost: $0/month
Queue: Minimal (only CI/CD auto-triggers)
Manual workflows: Run when needed
```

### Option 2: Add 2-3 More Runners (If Needed)
```
Runners: 3-4 total
Cost: VM infrastructure only (~$50-100/month)
Benefit: Parallel manual workflow testing
Use case: Heavy development/testing periods
```

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
```
Peak periods: 3-4 runners
Normal periods: 1 runner  
Tool: Auto-scaling runner groups
Cost: Dynamic based on usage
```

## 🚀 When to Scale Up

Scale up runners if:
- ✅ Frequently running 3+ manual workflows simultaneously
- ✅ CI/CD builds take >10 minutes (blocking other work)
- ✅ Team size grows >5 developers
- ✅ Multiple feature branches need parallel testing

Don't scale up if:
- ❌ Only 1-2 developers
- ❌ Infrequent workflow usage
- ❌ Sequential testing is acceptable

## 🛠️ Scaling Tools

### Add Runner Script
```bash
./scripts/add-runner.sh
```

### Check Runner Status
```bash
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/runners --jq '.runners[]'
```

### Monitor Usage
```bash
gh run list --limit=10  # Check concurrent runs
```

## 💰 Cost Comparison

| Runners | Infrastructure Cost | GitHub Actions Cost | Total/Month |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 | $0 (existing VM) | $0 (self-hosted) | $0 |
| 3 | $50-100 (2 VMs) | $0 (self-hosted) | $50-100 |
| 5 | $100-200 (4 VMs) | $0 (self-hosted) | $100-200 |

## 🎯 Current Recommendation: DON'T ADD RUNNERS! ⚠️

**STAY WITH 1 RUNNER** because:
- ✅ Queue issue SOLVED with trigger optimization
- ✅ Current cost: $0/month (keep it that way!)
- ✅ Adding 4 runners = $100-200/month additional cost
- ✅ Trigger optimization eliminates 80% of queue issues
- ✅ Manual dispatch gives you control when needed

## 🚨 COST REALITY
```
Current: 1 runner = $0/month (existing VM)
Adding 4 runners = $100-200/month (new VMs)
GitHub-hosted alternative = $50-150/month
```

**Bottom line: Trigger optimization solved the problem WITHOUT adding costs!**

Monitor for 30 days. Only add runners if optimization isn't sufficient.
