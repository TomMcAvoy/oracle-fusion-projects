# Copilot Note: Root Directory Organization

- Always keep the root directory clean and organized.
- Only essential project files (README.md, main build files, workspace config) should be in the root.
- Move scripts, Docker, Helm, and other assets into dedicated subfolders.
- Update documentation and script references when files are moved.
- Regularly review for stray or outdated files.

This note is for Copilot and maintainers to ensure best practices are followed.
