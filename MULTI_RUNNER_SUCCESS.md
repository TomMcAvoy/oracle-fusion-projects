## 📋 Final Steps to Complete Setup

### 1️⃣ **Register GitHub Actions Runner**

```bash
cd /home/tom/GitHub/oracle-fusion-projects/runners/github
./configure-github-runner.sh
```

**You'll need:**
- GitHub repo URL: `https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/oracle-fusion-projects`
- Registration token from: Repo Settings > Actions > Runners > "New self-hosted runner"

### 2️⃣ **Register GitLab Runner**

```bash
/tmp/register-gitlab-runner.sh
```

**You'll need:**
- GitLab registration token from: Project Settings > CI/CD > Runners

### 3️⃣ **Test Both Runners**

```bash
# Start both runners
./scripts/ci/runner-control.sh start all

# Monitor activity
watch -n 30 ./scripts/ci/runner-dashboard.sh

# Test workflows by pushing to both platforms
```
