# 🔧 Quick Fix Applied - Branch Detection

## ❌ **Issue Found**
The script was trying to push to `main` branch, but your repository uses `master`.

## ✅ **Fix Applied**
Updated the script to automatically detect the current branch:

```bash
# Before (hardcoded):
DEFAULT_BRANCH="main"

# After (dynamic):
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
```

## 🚀 **Now It Will Work**

The script will now:
- ✅ Detect you're on `master` branch
- ✅ Push to the correct branch on both platforms
- ✅ Work with any branch name you're using

## 🎯 **Let's Try Again**

```bash
./scripts/git/dual-commit.sh "Test dual platform commit with correct branch"
```

This should now work properly! 🎉
