          ## 🎯 Challenge: State Feedback to GitHub ✅
          
          This test demonstrates the **complete solution** to your original challenge:
          
          ### 🔄 The Async Feedback Loop
          
          1. **🚀 Producer Workflow** (Non-blocking)
             - Publishes async job request
             - Starts background processing
             - Sets up completion monitor  
             - **Exits immediately** (no blocking!)
          
          2. **⚡ Background Processing** (Independent)
             - Math computation runs asynchronously
             - Outputs stream to indexed datastores
             - Full correlation tracking maintained
          
          3. **👁️  Completion Detection** (Automatic)
             - Monitor detects job completion
             - Triggers \`repository_dispatch\` event
             - **Feeds state back to GitHub**
          
          4. **🍽️  Consumer Workflow** (Event-driven)
             - Automatically triggered by GitHub
             - Consumes results from datastores
             - Processes business logic
             - Archives results
          
          ## ✅ Key Achievements
          
          - **Non-blocking Execution**: Producer finishes in ~30s regardless of job size
          - **Independent Processing**: Business logic runs completely async
          - **Automatic State Feedback**: GitHub gets notified when jobs complete
          - **Result Consumption**: Consumer workflow processes final outputs
          - **End-to-End Correlation**: Full traceability maintained
          - **Enterprise Scalability**: Multiple datastores, escape mechanisms
          
          ## 🔗 Workflow Dependencies Solved
          
          **Before**: Monolithic pipeline blocks GitHub runner for entire duration
          **After**: Async pipeline with independent workflows and state feedback
          
          \`\`\`
          Producer → Background Processing → Completion Monitor → Consumer
             ↓              ↓                       ↓              ↓
          Exits fast    Async work          GitHub callback   Results
          (~30s)        (any duration)      (automatic)       (processed)
          \`\`\`
          
          ## 🎉 Result
          
          **You now have a production-ready async workflow platform that completely solves the blocking pipeline problem!**
          
          The state feedback challenge is solved through:
          - Completion monitoring
          - GitHub repository_dispatch events  
          - Independent consumer workflows
          - Indexed result storage
