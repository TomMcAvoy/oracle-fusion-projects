# ⚡ Quick Answer: Runner Port Usage

## 🎯 **TLDR: Do both runners listen on different ports?**

### **NO** - Neither runner listens on any ports!

---

## 📡 **How It Actually Works**

### 🐙 **GitHub Actions Runner**
```
GitHub Runner --HTTPS--> github.com:443
```
- ✅ **No listening ports**
- ✅ **Outbound connections only** 
- ✅ **Polls GitHub for jobs**

### 🦊 **GitLab CI Runner**  
```
GitLab Runner --HTTPS--> gitlab.com:443
```
- ✅ **No listening ports**
- ✅ **Outbound connections only**
- ✅ **Polls GitLab for jobs**

---

## 🔍 **Current Status (Live Analysis)**

```bash
📡 GitHub Actions Runner: Not running (ready for setup)
🦊 GitLab Runner: ✅ Running (PID: 136613)
   ✅ No listening ports (outbound only)
   📡 No active connections (waiting for jobs)

🏦 Vault Service: ✅ Port 8200 (containerized)
   📡 Only service that actually uses a port

📊 Available Ports: 3000, 5432, 6379, 8080, 9000
🔴 Occupied Ports: 8200 (Vault - expected)
```

## 🚫 **Why No Port Conflicts**

1. **Both are clients** - they connect outbound, don't accept connections
2. **Different targets** - GitHub vs GitLab servers
3. **No shared services** - completely independent
4. **No listening sockets** - pure polling model

---

## ⚠️ **Only Potential Conflict: Job Containers**

If workflow/pipeline jobs use the same Docker host ports:

```yaml
# This could conflict:
services:
  web:
    ports:
      - "8080:80"  # Both jobs want port 8080
```

**Solution:** Use container networking instead of host ports

## 📊 **Port Analysis Tool**

```bash
# Check current status anytime:
./scripts/ci/port-analysis.sh

# Monitor continuously:
watch -n 30 ./scripts/ci/port-analysis.sh
```

---

## ✅ **Conclusion**

**Both runners can run simultaneously with zero port conflicts** because they're designed as outbound-only clients, not servers.

The only thing using a port is Vault (8200), and that's intentional and isolated.

**Answer: No port conflicts! ✅**
